1. Hysteresis changes the voltage threshold for a digital detection depending on the
   currently detected digital state. This makes it impossible for a signal to consistently hang
   around the trigger point and stops unwanted digital switching.

2. Quantizing is converting an analog signal of infinite resolution to a digital signal with
   finite resolution. The resolution is based on the number of bits being used to descritize
   the signal.

3. Nyquist theory states that in order to represent a signal by sampling periodically, the
   sampling rate must be at least twice the frequency of the highest frequency in the signal.
   When sampling a signal too slowly information in the signal is lost.

4. this gives 2 to the 12 steps

5. Set operating mode, data resolution and trigger source. Start adc calibration. Wait for
   hardware to signal that calibration has completed.

6. left aligned mode is used for selecting the upper bits of a 16-bit number. right aligned
   is for selecting the lower bits

7. DAC_CR

8. I did not quite understand the purpose for needing left and right aligned data.
